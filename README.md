# OPTICS
A collection of code for some optics simulations related to generating Laser Speckle generation and also for Simulating the experimental Setup of 
Maga√±a-Loaizaet  al. Sci. Adv. 2016. LINK: https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/4/e1501143

Roughness_Sims holds simulations for 1d and 2d roughness profiles and their correlation and
Beam Propagation holds a collection of basic codes to be used in near future for speckle and OAM generation

Finally SLM gen contains my codes for replicating some of the results of the above paper along with a new direction towards simultaneous Polarisation and OAM characterisation using Intensity correlations.
