# OPTICS
A collection of code for some optics simulations related to generating Laser Speckle generation and also for Simulating the experimental Setup of 
Maga√±a-Loaizaet  al. Sci. Adv. 2016. LINK: https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/4/e1501143

Roughness_Sims holds simulations for 1d and 2d roughness profiles and their correlation and
Beam Propagation holds a collection of basic codes to be used in near future for speckle and OAM generation
